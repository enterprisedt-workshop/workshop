     <p>
	 In the dynamic landscape of technological advancements, the Digital Twin concept is emerging as a powerful tool with the potential to 
	transform traditional decision-making approaches for diverse and complex systems. 
	Technically, it offers a paradigm shift in our understanding and resolution of intricate problems by effectively 
	mirroring real-world entities. This enables us to comprehend their behaviors through simulation, 
	anticipate anomalies for outlier environmental conditions, and derive evidence-driven solutions. 
	While proven effective in physical and cyber-physical systems, its untapped potential lies in the realm of 
	techno-socio-economic systems that operate in dynamic and uncertain environments.
	
	The use of such technology in informed decision-making is significant for enterprises and society, as modern businesses and societal structures 
	demand innovative solutions that transcend conventional approaches. With the growing need, the global digital twin market is expected to 
	expand from $11.51 billion in 2023 to $137.67 billion by 2030, impacting domains such as manufacturing, healthcare, 
	sustainability, smart cities, and more. However, realizing this vast business potential hinges on advancing technological 
	capabilities and fostering innovation. This workshop aims to discuss the existing landscape of digital twins and explore uncharted
	 territory by harnessing the latent potential of Digital Twins within techno-socio-economic systems.

                <p><b><br>Title: Digital Twins for Control and Optimization</b></p>
                <p><b>Abstract:</b> Model-based control and optimization techniques have matured over the past fifty years and have been deployed on real-world systems of ever-increasing complexity. In parallel, model-free control techniques evolved under the umbrellas of reinforcement learning (RL) and adaptive control, and have been a subject of growing interest, partly because of a shared lineage with the field of artificial intelligence, although their practical use has been somewhat limited. Although the two approaches may seem orthogonal at first sight, they can be brought together gainfully for a broad range of practical problems wherein a nominal model is readily available in the form of a digital twin or a high-fidelity simulator, but the underlying system is prone to modelling and environmental uncertainties. I will illustrate this paradigm using examples based on business problems that came our way at TCS Research. The examples will demonstrate not only the utility of the digital twin as a control design aid but also the challenges associated with developing one for control.</p>

                <p><b>Abstract:</b> Water Resource Management has been a major area of concern in India with Floods and Draughts happening simultaneously looking at the multidimensional diversity in the region. Even though the idea of River Interconnection Project has been doing the rounds ever since independence, it's cost effectiveness and exact outcome were not easy to be predicted before. Digital Twin is a theme which finds its perfect application before taking up such a gigantic task. The talk will cover an Overall Problem Statement, various approaches in dealing with the issue like top-down or bottom-up or on basinwise phased implementation. Since the task is voluminous, it is major application of Big Data and there cannot be a unique solution. The talk stresses the need for multiple solutions and there proposed outcomes and testing them on multiple data sets.</p>

                <p><b><br>Title: Open simulation frameworks for building scalable digital twins.</b></p>
                <p><b>Abstract:</b> Digital Twins are becoming pervasive across many industries. For application domains such as manufacturing, a key challenge in their effective deployment is the development of open frameworks for modeling and scalable simulation of hybrid systems. These are systems consisting of interacting components modeled using different paradigms. Choosing the right modeling paradigm for each sub-system, and simulating the entire system at scale can be challenging. In this talk, I will present an overview of multiple modeling paradigms, with a focus on the challenges specific to digital twins and how simulation can be performed in each case. I will then discuss simulation approaches for hybrid systems and present our work in parallel cycle-based simulation and towards the development of a Python framework for hybrid (mixed discrete-event and continuous) simulation for digital twins.</p>
